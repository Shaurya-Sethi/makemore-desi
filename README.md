## Indian Name Generation with a Wavenet Language Model

---

### Project Overview


This project is a practical and research-inspired extension of Andrej Karpathy’s “makemore” language model series. Building on his invitation to beat his validation loss of 1.993 as an exercise, I set out to design, train, and evaluate a more expressive neural network on a custom dataset of Indian first names.


**Key contributions:**

* **Custom Dataset:** I webscraped, cleaned, and enhanced a large corpus of Indian first names using BeautifulSoup, custom Python scripts, and manual post-processing.
* **Wavenet-Style Model:** Implemented a character-level Wavenet-inspired neural network, utilizing dilated causal convolutions for efficient sequence modeling.
* **Modern Training Pipeline:** Leveraged PyTorch, robust batching, early stopping, and a careful validation strategy.
* **Beating the Benchmark:** Achieved a best validation loss of **1.6**, surpassing the result obtained by Karpathy’s original series on English names (1.993).

### Approach

1. **Data Acquisition & Preprocessing**

   * Scraped Indian first names from multiple online sources using custom Python scripts (`web scrapers/`).
   * Cleaned and normalized the data, removing duplicates and standardizing spelling using `data/preprocess.py`.
   * Final dataset contains thousands of unique, representative Indian names.

2. **Model Architecture**

   * Implemented a character-level neural language model based on the **Wavenet** design.
   * Utilizes dilated causal convolutions, residual/skip connections, and gated activations for efficient long-range sequence modeling.
   * Training objective: Predict the next character in a name given a fixed-length context window.

3. **Training & Evaluation**

   * Used PyTorch for model implementation and optimization.
   * Applied early stopping based on validation loss to avoid overfitting.
   * Achieved a best validation loss of **1.6** on the Indian names dataset, surpassing the original Makemore benchmark.

### Beating the Makemore Benchmark

> [00:55:26](https://youtu.be/t3YJ5hKiMQ0?si=ioFyoXNcSO-zxinV&t=3326) improve on my loss! how far can we improve a WaveNet on this data?
> — *Andrej Karpathy, Makemore Series, best val loss: 1.993*

By training on a focused dataset and leveraging a deeper convolutional stack, my model achieved a validation loss of **1.6**—demonstrating the power of modern sequence modeling, good data, and targeted architectural choices.

### Sampling: Unique Names Generated by the Model

Here are several unique Indian-sounding names generated by my trained Wavenet model:

```
upinder
mahal
jhangiya
koksha
thanavadhi
natyay
sambhranj
naadhpin
aadhura
vaisadul
indubaben
akunashag
saudha
ujasv
sarjharam
kalamglokh
kurandita
arnie
anakina
indarya
alkaihat
olima
rigan
anuhula
ikkant
aahridha
harbendranja
hanjayan
ujamanga
umminder
aiesht
rajwal
hurarimatmi
izwal
ahimul
ekdeep
aakanhoon
itorin
najpan
yashabeen
akyar
raghuva
ikbad
adhithir
echank
yuven
afri
roop
esak
urgamelvam
oufaa
ambleka
raqida
inderveen
ratriza
ehika
afbrah
afini
elakta
hurina
```

These names include plausible, never-before-seen blends, and creative combinations inspired by authentic Indian names.

### On Name Meaning and Cultural Context

Most Indian names are chosen for their specific meanings and deep cultural significance—often reflecting virtues, values, or religious and historical roots. For example, my own name, Shaurya, means "bravery." This project generates novel names purely as an educational and technical experiment in sequence modeling. The generated names are not intended to be meaningful or culturally accurate, and no offense is meant to any tradition or community. Rather, this work aims to explore language modeling and creativity within the context of Indian phonetics and name structures.

### Usage

**Dependencies:**
Install requirements via pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Train the model:**

```bash
python src/train_wavenet.py
```


**Generate new names:**

```bash
python src/generate_names.py --n 20 --temperature 1.1
```

**Sampling can be customized for name count and creativity (temperature).**

---

**Command-line help:**

You can view all available options and their descriptions by running:

```bash
python src/generate_names.py --help
```

This will display:

```
usage: generate_names.py [-h] [--n N] [--temperature TEMPERATURE]

Generate Indian names using a pre-trained WaveNet model.

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --n N                 Number of names to generate. (default: 20)
  --temperature TEMPERATURE
                        Sampling temperature (e.g., >1.0 for more creative, <1.0 for more conservative names). (default: 1.0)
```

### Interactive Web App

This project now includes a Streamlit web app for interactive name generation.

**Features:**
- **Interactive Controls:** Adjust the starting letter, number of names, and temperature (creativity) in real-time.
- **Save Favorites:** Select the names you like and keep a running list.
- **Download Your List:** Save your favorite names to a `.txt` file with a single click.

**How to run the app:**
1. Make sure you have all the dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. Run the Streamlit app from your terminal:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
The app will open in your default web browser.
